## Steps to Run the Model

1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook to run the code. (You need to have a Google account for doing so.)
2. Go to the following Github repository: [Handsign Model Code](https://github.com/MajorProject221/Handsign_digit_model/)
3. In the repository, locate the two files with the extension `.txt`.
4. In the first notebook, paste each section from the file [handwritten_digit_recognition.txt](https://github.com/MajorProject221/Handsign_digit_model/blob/main/handwritten_digit_recognition.txt) into separate code blocks in the notebook you created.
5. Each section in the notebook has an execution button.
   - Run each section sequentially from top to bottom.
   - When prompted to save the model, grant the necessary permissions.
6. After completing the first phase, create a new notebook for the next phase.
7. Download the dataset from the following link on Kaggle: [Sign Language Digits Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/javaidahmadwani/sign-language-digits-dataset)
8. Upload the downloaded dataset folder to your Google Drive so that the images can be accessed.
9. Go back to the Github repository and open the file [handsign_digit_model.txt](https://github.com/MajorProject221/Handsign_digit_model/blob/main/handsign_digit_model.txt).
10. Similar to the previous notebook, run each section of code in separate code blocks sequentially.
11. Running this code will also require granting Google Drive permissions.
12. The trained models will be saved in a separate folder in the `.hdf5` format, ready to be used for different applications in the future.

Note: Make sure to adjust any file paths or configurations in the code based on your specific setup.
